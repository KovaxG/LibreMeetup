Hello, and welcome. This site is a free substitute to meetup RSVPing.

We assure you that this site does not track you at all. You can verify this by looking at the actual source code that can be found on this <a href="https://github.com/KovaxG/LibreMeetup">github link</a>, or just to drive the point home, can also be found at the bottom of the website. 

I invite everyone, especially non-technical people to look at the source code, and see what this stuff looks like.
